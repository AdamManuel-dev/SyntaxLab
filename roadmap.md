### 🚧 Deliverables
- AI-aware mutation testing (MuTAP)
- Hallucination detection (pattern-based and semantic)
- Prompt injection detection engine
- SAST/DAST security pipeline
- Performance profiling & optimization feedback

### 📈 Success Metrics
- >93.5% mutation bug detection

### 🚧 Deliverables
- Interactive improvement mode (natural language refinement)
- Learning engine and pattern extractor
- Prompt optimizer (genetic + statistical)
- Knowledge base and semantic clustering
- A/B testing framework for generations

### 📈 Success Metrics
- 30% generation quality improvement
- 50% reduction in improvement cycles
- 90%+ pattern recognition accuracy
- 57% faster completion with learned context

---

## 🧬 Phase 5: Advanced Mutation System (Weeks 25–30)

### 🎯 Summary
