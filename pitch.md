🎙️ SyntaxLab — General Partner Pitch Script (90 Seconds)

Hi, I’m [Your Name], co-founder of SyntaxLab.

Every software problem has thousands of correct implementations. But today’s AI tools give you one — unchecked, untested, and often wrong.

SyntaxLab flips that model. We treat code generation as a search and optimization problem, not a typing shortcut. Our platform explores the space of possible implementations using multiple LLMs, then filters them with enterprise-grade validation: mutation testing, hallucination detection, compliance scanning — all automated.

The result? Code that isn’t just syntactically valid — it’s tested, compliant, and deployment-ready. That’s the key difference between autocomplete and audit-ready code.

We’ve built this on a formal mathematical foundation: multi-objective optimization, graph traversal, and empirical scoring. That gives us strong IP defensibility, compounding product performance, and differentiated trust — especially for regulated industries.

We’re already running pilots with healthcare, fintech, and cloud infrastructure teams — $90k in revenue, 50K+ test cases validated, and benchmarks showing 2–5x productivity gains and 75% QA cost reductions.

This is a $50B+ market that starts at dev tooling but expands into compliance, observability, and AI agent safety.

We’re raising $3M to reach $1M ARR, expand GTM, and own the infrastructure layer for AI-native software teams. If GitHub Copilot is the front-end, we’re building the back-end trust layer — the control system for enterprise-scale AI code.
