# SyntaxLab One-Pager: Executive Summary

## 🎯 Mission

**SyntaxLab is redefining AI-assisted software development as a search, optimization, and validation problem.**
We empower teams to generate, test, and deploy enterprise-grade code with confidence.

---

## 🧠 What We Do

SyntaxLab is an AI-powered code generation platform that:

* **Samples** from multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, OSS)
* **Validates** using mutation testing, hallucination detection, and compliance scanning
* **Optimizes** for correctness, maintainability, cost, and security
* **Learns** through prompt feedback and pattern caching

> Think of it as a multi-objective optimizer over all possible valid implementations of a feature — not a glorified autocomplete.

---

## 🔍 Formal Framing

* **Mathematical Optimization**: Search over $\mathcal{X}$, a space of valid code outputs, using utility functions $U(x)$
* **Graph Traversal**: Code states as nodes, edits and mutations as edges, traversed with heuristics

This lets SyntaxLab guarantee correctness, safety, and policy enforcement, not just text generation.

---

## 📊 Results

* **HumanEval**: 4/20 Pareto-optimal solutions with >95% test success
* **MuTAP**: 94% initial mutation score, improved to 98% post-feedback
* **Delivery time**: 2–5x speedup
* **QA cost**: 75–85% reduction
* **Compliance**: 95% pre-commit detection (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)

---

## 🏁 Market & Momentum

* **3 enterprise pilots**: Health, fintech, infrastructure
* **\$90k pilot revenue**
* **50K+ mutation tests run**
* **\$50B+ addressable market**: Dev tooling, AI Ops, Compliance Automation

---

## 💼 Business Model
