🧩 Core Pillars of the Platform

🔗 AI-Orchestration

Smart routing between Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and open models using cost-performance tradeoffs.

🔐 Secure Collaboration

End-to-end enterprise controls: RBAC, audit logs, zero-data-leak guarantees, and optional air-gapped mode.

🔁 Continuous Learning

Cross-team pattern propagation, federated learning, and prompt improvement via usage telemetry.

📊 Enterprise Observability

Role-based dashboards, predictive alerts, compliance exports, and cost forecasting.

🚀 Flexible Deployment

Single binary for startups, Docker for mid-size teams, and K8s + Terraform for enterprises.
